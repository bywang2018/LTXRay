# LTXRay
## INTRODUCTION
LTXRay consists of 18,718 images from 12 common classes, with $20 \sim 5,607$ instances per class labeled with bounding-box annotations. Notably, the imbalance factor of entire dataset reaches 280.35. To the best of our knowledge, LTXRay is the first benchmark dedicated to the task of long-tailed prohibited item detection.
